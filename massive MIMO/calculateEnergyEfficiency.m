% Function to calculate energy efficiency
function energyEfficiency = calculateEnergyEfficiency(transmissionRate)
    % Calculate energy efficiency based on transmission rate
    % Implement your logic here to calculate the energy efficiency
    % For example:
    energyConsumption = calculateEnergyConsumption(transmissionRate); % Calculate energy consumption
    energyEfficiency = transmissionRate ./ energyConsumption;
end
% Function to calculate energy consumption
function energyConsumption = calculateEnergyConsumption(transmissionRate)
    % Calculate energy consumption based on transmission rate
    % Implement your logic here to calculate the energy consumption
    % For example:
    constantPower = 10; % Constant power consumption
    energyConsumption = constantPower + transmissionRate.^2; % Example calculation
end
